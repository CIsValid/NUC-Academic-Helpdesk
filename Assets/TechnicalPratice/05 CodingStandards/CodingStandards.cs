    /* Its of our best intrest to follow up with the coding standards. If you're just interested in being able to create something with code then this isnt as important
       However if you ever code with others on a team its extremely important to follow the coding standards or else you will find yourself spending a lot more time on
       trying to understand what eachother have done instead of progressing and actually writing code.
    */

    /* Not following the coding standards will make it harder to come back and edit code in the future as well so best trick and adviced trick is to just do it properly ^^ */

    /* Plus its not thaaaaaat much to remember */

    /* Like mentioned in 03 Naming Conventions we discussed a few elements of Coding Standards with using camel Case for variables and Pascal Case for Functions */

    /* This is a more deep dive into the topic */

    // NOTE: I would like for you to head over to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-sharp-coding-standards/ and quickly read over.
    // This will give you a really strong foundation when it comes to writing code.



       /* CONGRATS! MODULE 04 HAS BEEN COMPLETED! Well done! :) */
